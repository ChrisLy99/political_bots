    "# Abstract\n",
    "We will analyze the users who interact with the Twitter accounts of various popular news networks to compare their alignment across the U.S. political spectrum. We will be collecting hashtags used in the users' home timelines to classify their political stance as well as create a graph analysis between the news networks as a whole. Through this, we demonstrate the location where each news network lies on the U.S. political spectrum and how they lie relative in hashtag vector space to one another."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "The major television news networks have always played a key role in delivering important news and information to the public in a predictable and concise manner tailored to their viewers. As a result of this conformation to the preferences of their respective audiences, many news networks have developed a tendency to report news with a bias in various aspects of reporting; most notably, the most prevalent defining characteristic of a news network is its political affiliation. This often leads to skewed information motivated by viewership and rating results.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the bipartisan split in television news networks can be seen in the contrast between CNN and Fox news. CNN is widely considered to be a left-leaning or democratic organization, while Fox is catered to a republican audience. This polarization of news is often criticized as furthering the tunnel vision in viewers by only showing them what they already agree with. Similar to “echo chambers” in The Spread of Misinformation Online, Vicario et al.[1], this action of reporting biased news creates isolated communities of viewers where information is often circulated within their own groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although most news media outlets already have a pretty well defined political alignment, our analysis will involve further verifying this classification and comparing these news stations on different spectrums other than political affiliation. Our goal in this project is to quantify the political inclination (pro-democrat vs pro-republic) of eight news stations. In other words, we want to construct a political spectrum and see how these new stations fall on the spectrum.\n"

    "# Data\n",
    "## Collection\n",
    "Through use of the Twitter API, we are able to gather any data that was made publicly available on the Twitter platform. Per the terms of this API, we are unable to access any tweet that is protected by a private account or has been deleted. Although we are collecting tweet data from individual users, we will only be analyzing aggregated values from hashtags and will not be releasing any individual data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The eight news stations we chose were BBCWorld, BreitbartNews, CBS, CNN, FoxNews, MSNBC, RT_America, nytimes, and washingtonpost. We decided on these accounts as they are all relatively well-known and we wanted to have a sample of media outlets that were distributed along the political spectrum and therefore chose outlets that are left, neutral and right leaning. Since the goal of our project is to analyze the users that actively interact with each news station, we needed to gather a sizable sample of tweets to quantify the general trend of political affiliation. Our steps were as follows: sample the most recent tweets from each news outlet, gather all retweeters in each tweet, and then finally examine the retweeters by collecting the counts of hashtags used in each retweeter’s timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main portion of our data collection process was gathering the users that actively interact with the Twitter accounts of major news stations. We looked at the most recent 100 posts from each news outlet and collected every retweet and subsequently every user who retweeted the post. After collecting these users, we randomly sampled 500 users from each news station and gathered the most recent 1000 tweets from each user’s timeline. If a user did not have 1000 tweets, we simply took their entire timeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "From these tweets, we collected every hashtag used and took down the occurrence of each hashtag. To account for minor variations in hashtag spelling and syntax, we stored each hashtag in its lowercase form. Each news outlet now has a list of hashtags along with a mapping of the respective number of times used in a tweet. This information will be used as a hashtag vector in our graph analysis elaborated further in the methodology section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our definition of a user that \"actively interacts\" with a news outlet is someone who has retweeted one of the outlet's tweets in the past 3 months. Although it may have been easier to collect users from the news outlets' follower lists, we wanted to ensure our users analyzed were active on their Twitter so that we can analyze how they interact with current political accounts and tweets.\n",

    "## Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "As the end goal of our project is to utilize hashtag usage for comparison of news outlets, we wanted to begin by looking at the most commonly used hashtags relative to each news outlet. We believed that the most noticeable difference in hashtag trends would be politically motivated as the traditional consensus is that these eight news outlets all have some sort of political affiliation or bias in their reporting, attracting users of the same political alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we looked to aggregate hashtag frequencies and compare the distributions across each news outlet. There were a few common hashtags found across all eight news stations such as variations of “covid-19” and “trump”. These words have relatively neutral meaning in terms of political leaning and therefore looked into the effect of removing them in our methodology.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first visualization was a \"Word Cloud\" designed to display the most popular hashtags used in each news outlet. We hypothesized that there will be a quantifiable difference in the hashtags used by users of each news outlet due to the difference in population of their active users. \n",
    "\n",
    "A brief glimpse into the figures below show that there is indeed a noticeable difference in hashtag usage between users of each news outlet. We found that politically charged words demonstrate the most prevalent separation between each collection of hashtags and verifies our hypothesis that the user trends of news outlets can be separated based on their hashtag usage.\n"
